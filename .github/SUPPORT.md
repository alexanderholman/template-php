## Getting help
At Alexander Holman, when it comes to help we follow the mantra `Read, Search, Ask` as set out by [FreeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.org) 
details of which can be found [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/read-search-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-743a23c411b4). 

In short, before asking someone else for help, first try to figure it out on your own by:
* Read the documentation or error.
* Search [Google](https://google.com), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), [Reddit](https://reddit.com) and 
other similar sources for posts of users experiencing the same or similar issues to you.

If you have tried the above options with no luck, waste no more time and ask. Remember **NEVER POST PERSONAL OR 
SENSITIVE INFORMATION PUBLICLY!** Carefully read over and omit anything that might be considered **FOR INTERNAL USE 
ONLY**, and if you aren't sure then *ask first*.

Start by asking one of the core team members if you can, details can be found in the [AUTHORS](/AUTHORS.md) document. 
If that doesn't work out for any reason, try asking internally or those you know. Finally you could try posting your 
question on any one of the developer forums (including those you tried during your search).
